Libraries implemented and required to be installed for the code to execute:

numpy :: for matrices and other associated numerical calculations. 
math :: for all mathematical operations
heapq :: for priority queue
time :: for measuring the time
cv2 :: for image related operations (OpenCV 4.xx)
pygame :: For animations
matplotlib:: To plot the graphs and see the path taken by the robot from the start to the goal node

This README file is for two codes
The programme solves the obstacle map based on the Dijkstras Algorithm. 

Code : Solves the obstacle map based on the A* Algorithm For Rigid Robot with a radius and clearance

The following inputs are required by the user:

x_start= the x coordinate of the start
y_start= y coordinate of the start
orientation = starting orientation of the Robot
x_goal= x coordinate of the goal
y_goal= y coordinate of the goal
Radius = Radius of the robot
Clearence = Clearance of the robot


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time for solution for the following inputs:
##############################################################################################
Enter the x coordinate of the start:  50

Enter the y coordinate of the start:  30

Enter the Orientation at start (enter in multiples of 30 degreees and less that 360 degrees), :  60

Enter the x coordinate of the goal:  150

Enter the y coordinate of the goal:  150

Enter the radius of the robot:  1

Enter the clearance of the robot: 1
##############################################################################################

was around 2050 seconds (~33 minutes).

Both codes takes a few minutes to solve (subject to the system specifications), and then output 
the following:

##After Reaching the goal, the backtracking will commence.

## Once the backtracking is complete the following sets of outputs are given out:

> Image of the obstacles (OpenCV)

> Animation showing the visited nodes and the backtracked path (using pygame)

> Graph plot showing path of solution (MatplotLib)

> Image of the visited nodes (OpenCV)

> Image of backtracked path (OpenCV)

> Graph plot showing children direction for each parent (MatplotLib)

> Zoomed in version of the quivers generated (MatplotLib)

NOTE: All graphs are saved into the folder. They have been pre-uploaded into the submission folder, 
however, they can be obtained again by running the same code.
